# fotoRenamer
Python-Script to rename picture files. 

! ! ! This script works only on Macs and depends on depends on the Exiftool by Phil Harvey ! ! !

The script reads the exifdata from pictures to obtain the original date of creation. 
The script then renames the current file to have the name of the date of creation. 
The script is also capable to rename entire folders.

Feel free to modify the script to your desire.

Have fun
